#Insights from project: 
1)Sales and Profit Growth: The sales for the Sample Superstore have shown a consistent increase from 2015 to 2018. The sales figure has risen steadily over the years, indicating a positive trend for the business. Additionally, the profit has also experienced significant growth, more than doubling from $477,797 in 2015 to $1,042,204 in 2018. This demonstrates that not only are sales increasing, but the company is also effectively managing its costs and maximizing profitability.

2)Increase in Units Sold: The number of units sold per year has shown a notable increase from 2015 to 2018, rising from 6,234 units to 13,299 units. This indicates a growing customer demand for the Sample Superstore's products. The increase in sales quantity suggests that the business is attracting more customers and successfully meeting their needs, leading to a higher volume of products sold.

3)Sales by Categories: Analyzing sales by categories reveals that the highest sales are generated from the Copiers category, while the lowest sales come from the Labels category. This suggests that the Sample Superstore should focus more on promoting and selling copiers, as they are more popular and in demand compared to labels. By identifying the categories that contribute the most to sales, the company can allocate resources strategically to maximize revenue.

4)Profit by Segment: When examining profit by segment, it is evident that the Consumer segment accounts for 50% of the total sales. This suggests that the Sample Superstore's consumer products are highly profitable and have a strong customer base. To maintain and further increase profitability, the company should continue catering to the needs and preferences of the consumer segment, potentially by introducing new consumer-focused products or marketing campaigns.

5)Order and Returns Patterns: The analysis of order and return data reveals that the month of August consistently sees the highest number of orders and returns across all three years, except for 2015. This indicates a recurring pattern, where customers are more active during August, both in terms of placing orders and returning products. Understanding this trend can help the Sample Superstore prepare for increased customer activity during this period, ensuring sufficient stock, optimizing logistics, and implementing effective return management processes.

6)Top Ordering Country: France emerges as the country with the highest number of orders, totaling 858,931. This insight highlights the importance of the French market for the Sample Superstore. To capitalize on this, the company can invest in localized marketing efforts, customer support, and potentially even consider expanding its presence or partnerships in France to further boost sales and customer satisfaction.
